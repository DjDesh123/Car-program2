## Introduction
This is a refactoring of my first big C program that I have done in my first year of university. After evaluating this project I realsied I used fairly simple concepts and less effective solutions to my code like not using dynamic memeory allocation and decidng to only handle situations in stack memory. While my original attempt of this project can function i realsiedf that it can be done more effectively and efficently which is a main part of programming that I want to learn and create.

## diffulty and challenges
i ran into diffiuclties as i started with the file handling and realsied i couldnt effectively test the code and it would start to be a lot easier if i had the ground works ready first so i changed my main foucsed and started the script by running core conecepts.
